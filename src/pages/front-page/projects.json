The split navigation system made it difficult to keep everything correctly centered, but with a bit of flexbox magic, everything lines up perfectly. This site uses WooCommerce with quite a bit of custom logic behind-the-scenes to calculate membership dues, expiration dates, and more. Be sure to check out the member&apos;s login screen to get a sense of what it might be like looking through a porthole aboard the USS Illinois.",
